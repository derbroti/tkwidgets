## Fork notes

This is my out-of-tree fork where I maintain some customizations (mostly stylistic ones).

# tkwidgets

This is a fork of a CLI GUI framework based on [terminal-kit](https://github.com/cronvel/terminal-kit) to support [Joplin](https://joplin.cozic.net).

It is currently undocumented but usage examples can be found in the Joplin source code.

## Installation

    npm install tkwidgets
